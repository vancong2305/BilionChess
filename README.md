## Description
Inspired by Monopoly, Merchant Chess introduces a unique and engaging gameplay experience. Merchants challenge each other to a duel, traveling through twenty different lands determined by random draws from the referee. Merchants can hire mercenaries to block their competitors' paths in the lands they visit. 

What cannot be bought with money can be bought with a lot of money; merchants can bribe other merchants' mercenaries with exorbitant prices when they encounter them. However, money isn't everything. If a merchant's health index drops to 0, they lose the game.
