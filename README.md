Inspired by Monopoly. We plan to do things differently with new, more unique gameplay. </br>
The merchants challenged each other to a duel, that they would travel through twenty different lands under random draws from the referee. </br>
Merchants can hire mercenaries to block other merchants' paths in the lands they visit. </br>
Similarly, what cannot be bought with money can be bought with a lot of money, </br>
they can bribe other merchants' mercenaries with exorbitant prices when they come to that land. </br> 
However, money is only almost omnipotent, if the trader's health index drops to 0 he will lose. </br>
Skipping the draw three times will also result in losing.
