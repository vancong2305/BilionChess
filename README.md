Description:</br>
Inspired by Monopoly. We plan to do things differently with new, more unique gameplay. <br>
The merchants challenged each other to a duel, that they would travel through twenty different lands under random draws from the referee. <br>
Merchants can hire mercenaries to block other merchants' paths in the lands they visit. <br>
Similarly, what cannot be bought with money can be bought with a lot of money, <br>
they can bribe other merchants' mercenaries with exorbitant prices when they come to that land. <br> 
However, money is only almost omnipotent, if the trader's health index drops to 0 he will lose. <br>

The project is for research purposes, serving learning, the images are collected online.  <br>
And we do not use images for commercial purposes.
